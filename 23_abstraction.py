abstraction ='''Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary implementation 
details and exposing only the essential features of an object or system.
It simplifies interaction by allowing users to work with a clear interface 
without needing to understand the internal complexity.
_________
🟣 Abstract class is a blueprint for other classes.
It cannot be instantiated(you can't create objects from it's directly),
and it's meant to be inherited.
It usually defines abstract methods, that must be implemented
in subclasses.
---------

Why use Abstract Classes?
 • To provide a common API for related classes.
 • To force subclasses to implement specific methods.
 • To support polymorphism (treat different subclasses uniformly).
 • To share common code while leaving implementation details to subclasses.

✅ Option 1: Using ABC (Simplest & Recommended), 
             need to import abc module
'''

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MyBase(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def do_something(self):
        pass
#  • ABC internally sets metaclass=ABCMeta.
#  • Cleaner and easier to read.

part_two = '''
✅ Option 2: Manually Setting ABCMeta as the Metaclass
'''

from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod

class MyBase2(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def do_something(self):
        pass
# • This is more explicit and gives control over custom metaclass behavior

error = '''
⚠️ What Happens If a Subclass Doesn’t Implement Abstract Methods?
❌ Error Example:
'''

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        pass

a = Animal()  # ❌ Can't instantiate, Raises error here
# TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class MyBase without an implementation

class Dog(Animal):
    pass  # Missing implementation!

d = Dog()  # ❌ Raises error here
# TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Dog with abstract method speak

🔍 Why This Happens

 • Python uses the ABCMeta metaclass to check:
 • “Does the subclass implement all required abstract methods?”
 • If not, Python prevents the object from being created — this is enforced at instantiation time, not class definition
 
⚙️ In Python, abstract classes created using ABCMeta 
   automatically get a special attribute -
   .__abstractmethods__., so we have access internally:
'''

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self): pass

    @abstractmethod
    def move(self): pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self): return "Woof!"

print(Animal.__abstractmethods__)

# {'speak', 'move'}

print(Dog.__abstractmethods__)

# {'move'} — speak is implemented, move is not

🧠 Under the Hood

 • Python’s ABCMeta sets __abstractmethods__ when an abstract (or subclass) is created.
 • It’s a frozenset — immutable and introspectable.
 • It directly drives the following error at runtime:
    - TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Dog with abstract method move
 • This error occurs only if __abstractmethods__ of the subclass is non-empty.

 🔍 When is it checked?
 → At instantiation time (i.e., when calling the constructor).
